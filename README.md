1.Project Overview: Exploratory Analysis of Synthetic Customer Transaction Data
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, from data generation and cleaning to descriptive statistics and visualization. Using Python's core data science libraries, it simulates a real-world scenario where raw transaction data is transformed into actionable business insights.

2.Features & Tasks
The project is structured into five core deliverables as required by the "Job Readiness" project brief:
Synthetic Data Generation: Creation of a dataset with over 1,000 records including features such as CustomerID, Age, PurchaseAmount, ProductCategory, and TransactionDate.

3.Data Cleaning: Initial inspection of data types and column counts, followed by handling missing values through median imputation or removal.
Descriptive Analysis: Calculation of central tendency (Mean, Median) and dispersion (Standard Deviation) for numerical data, alongside frequency counts for top categorical features.

4.Data Visualization: Generation of three distinct plots—a histogram for distribution, a bar chart for categorical counts, and a box plot or scatter plot to identify relationships.

5.Summary Reporting: A brief interpretation of results and key findings derived from the statistical outputs.

 Key Insights (Derived from Data)
Based on the implemented Python analysis, the following trends were identified:
Central Tendency: The average customer transaction is approximately 509.53, with a median age of 45 years.
Top Categories: "Electronics" and "Books" represent the highest transaction volumes.
Spending Behavior: Box plot analysis reveals consistent median spending across categories, though "Electronics" shows a wider range of price points.
Technologies Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For synthetic data generation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating high-quality data visualizations.
